ScriptDB
========

**Download the [latest release][1] from GitHub!**

ScriptDb is a C# console app that uses SQL Management Objects (SMO) to script database objects. It was [originally written][2] by [Jesse Hersch][3] (see his copyright information below).


Highlights of my version:

* script table data to sql (INSERT statements), csv (using http://www.heikniemi.fi/jhlib/), or bcp
* specify tables for which to script data on the command line or in a file
* run commands on startup, shutdown, and before and after scripting a database
* script view indexes, full-text indexes, and statistics
* use safe output filenames
* improved command line interface

The most significant change is the ability to run commands. This allows you to do things like scripting databases directly into source control with a single command.

### Examples

Here's a simple command to script the schema of tables, views, and stored procedures into a single file for the Northwind database on localhost, using trusted auth:

    scriptdb.exe --database=Northwind --outputfile=Northwind.sql 

And a slightly more complicated command to script all databases on a server into a git repository (which you created first and set up an "origin" remote for) using trusted auth:

	scriptdb.exe --server=DBSERVER --scriptalldatabases --outputdirectory=c:\repos\DbServerScripts --startcommand="git -C \"{path}\" reset --hard" --postscriptingcommand="cmd /c git -C \"{path}\" add . && ( git -C \"{path}\" diff-index --quiet HEAD || git -C \"{path}\" commit -m \"Updating {database}\" )" --finishcommand="git -C \"{path}\" push origin master"

(The startcommand clears out any changes; the postscripting command stages all changes, and if there are any, commits them; and the finishcommand pushes committed changes to the remote.)

Here's a really complicated command to use ScriptDB along with https://github.com/bhank/SVNCompleteSync to script all databases on a server to SVN:

    scriptdb.exe --server=DBSERVER --username=SQLLOGIN --password=SQLPASSWORD --scriptalldatabases --outputdirectory=scripts\{serverclean} --purge --datatablefile=ScriptDataTables.txt --tableonefile --scriptdatabase  --startcommand="SvnClient.exe checkoutupdate \"https://svnserver/svn/svnrepo/trunk/Databases/{serverclean}\" \"{path}\" --mkdir --message=\"Adding server {server}\" --cleanworkingcopy --verbose --trust-server-cert" --prescriptingcommand="cmd /c echo Scripting {database} at %TIME%" --postscriptingcommand="SvnClient.exe completesync --message=\"Updating {database} on {server}\" \"{path}\{databaseclean}\" --verbose --trust-server-cert"

And here's a breakdown of what it's doing:

`scriptdb.exe`

* `--server=DBSERVER` - connect to DBSERVER (omit this for localhost)
* `--username=SQLLOGIN --password=SQLPASSWORD` - use this SQL login (omit this for trusted auth)
* `--scriptalldatabases` - script all the databases on the server (specify --database=DatabaseName to script just one)
* `--outputdirectory=scripts\{serverclean}` - put the output in a subdirectory under scripts, named after the SQL server, but with any illegal characters cleaned out
* `--purge` - delete existing files from this directory before scripting (so that when we commit, any database objects which no longer exist will be removed from SVN)
* `--datatablefile=ScriptDataTables.txt` - use this file to determine the tables in each database for which data should be scripted, rather than just schema. The lines of this file look like "DatabaseName:Table,OtherTable,WildcardTables*,YetAnotherTable"
* `--tableonefile` - put indexes, triggers, etc. for a table all in the same file as the table itself, rather than in separate files
* `--scriptdatabase` - script the database itself too -- but I don't think this works yet
* `--startcommand="SvnClient.exe checkoutupdate \"https://svnserver/svn/svnrepo/trunk/Databases/{serverclean}\" \"{path}\" --mkdir --message=\"Adding server {server}\" --cleanworkingcopy --verbose --trust-server-cert"` - on startup, ensure that a clean up-to-date working copy for the SVN URL for this SQL server exists in the output directory, creating it in SVN if necessary, checking it out if it isn't already checked out, reverting any changes, and updating it
* `--prescriptingcommand="cmd /c echo Scripting {database} at %TIME%"` - print the time before starting to script each database (not really necessary)
* `--postscriptingcommand="SvnClient.exe completesync --message=\"Updating {database} on {server}\" \"{path}\{databaseclean}\" --verbose --trust-server-cert"` - commit changes (if any) to SVN after scripting each database, adding any new files and deleting any missing files
